# deep-learning-challenge
Machine Learning with Hidden Layers to determine succesful funding candidates (part of 2U Data Analytics Bootcamp)

## Where to find stuff
* All of the setup and training for the model is available in the `Charity Selection ML Model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
* The written report, `Charity Candidate Prediction for Alphabet Soup.docx` was written in Microsoft Word and (clearly) saved under Microsoft's proprietary format. If you wish to read it and do not have Office, I recommend Google Drive. Feel free to reach out if you want a copy in a more widely-accessible format.
* The final model weights are contained in the `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5` file

## Work
All optimizations, list comprehensions, etc are my own work. Basic research was done online for syntax quesitons. I briefly consulted with fellow student Riley Capps to trade details on how the project was coming along (such as the difficulty achieving the optimization target).
